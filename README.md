# My Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio web application built with React and TypeScript.  
It showcases my professional experience, projects, skills, and contact information.

## Features

- Responsive, modern UI
- About, Experience, Projects, and Contact sections
- Animated and interactive components
- SCSS for modular and maintainable styles
- Linting and pre-commit checks with Husky

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash

   ```

## Linting & Pre-commit

This project uses ESLint and Husky to ensure code quality.  
Lint checks run automatically before each commit.
